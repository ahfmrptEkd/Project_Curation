Her half-sister isn't actually her half-sister, she is Conor's half-sister--the result of Conor's dad having an affair. The happy couple is back together and the seven brothers confront their dad, but everyone is happy to finally have a girl in the family. Loved Conor, this book was great until the half-sibling cheating plot. Just why was that necessary. This book would've been four stars if not  for that twist.   \n",

Anyway, you know hate leads to sex and sex leads to feelings and Blair isn't a bad person she is just really fucking traumatized. Overall this book I think has the most well-rounded plot. The only insane plot twist is at the end of the epilogue when we are left with the cliffhanger of Colt being in a car accident.  Also, it says it is enemies to lovers, but only Cody really hates Blair. Blair actually had a crush on Cody through most of high school and college.   \n",
